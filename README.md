"# idfl-inspect-project" 

I plan to complete the project in 3 stages.

Step 1,

the beginning of the project, defining models and managing the project through the django admin panel,
(My goal here is to analyze and interpret the project correctly)

Step 2,

I will develop APIs and share the information required for the angular project with the API. Save, Delete, List operations will be done through APIs.

Step 3 will be an angular project

By doing the design work you requested here, I will establish a connection with the API.
